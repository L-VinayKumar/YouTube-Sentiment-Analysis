# **YouTube Sentiment-Analysis**

With the prevalence of social media, people are more familiar with publicly sharing their opinions these days. Some people even become content creators on major social media platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube. Therefore, these websites are ideal resources for sentiment analysis. By deploying the technique, the efficiency of social monitoring and brand marketing are enhanced. Creators and brands can perceive the viewers' emotion provoked by the content they create, and further decide whether there are adjustments to make.

## Conclusion:

The discussion demonstrates that sentiment analysis is still subject to the context. Without the context, emotions cannot be precisely expressed. Stopword is proven by the study that it is one of the aspects that we can still work on.

From this study, we learn lots of sentiment analysis tools that are handy to use. Although it did not provide 100% accuracy when interpreting the emotions, it saved our time, and showed its potential in the combination of natural language processing and linguistics.
